All the directories in here contain files explaining a feature, the speciality
of it and some tests. A file is split into several blocks, separated by a
80 char dash line.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following blocks are there (in this order):

1. (not defined yet, will be some meta data for documentation compilation)
2. Generic description (documentation part)
3. An example template using the feature and being used for the test.
4. The variables (JSON) available when executing the test
5. The expected result
